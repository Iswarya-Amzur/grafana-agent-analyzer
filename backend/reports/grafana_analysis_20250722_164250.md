## üîç Detailed Analysis

### Infrastructure Widgets
- **CPU Utilization**: Moderate usage at 26.12%, but without trend data, it's difficult to predict future performance. Duplicate entries suggest consistent monitoring but need trend analysis.
- **Total CPU Cores**: Maxed out at 306.95, indicating potential overload. Immediate investigation required to prevent performance degradation.

### System Widgets  
- **Thais Connection**: Maxed out at 30, indicating a potential network bottleneck. Requires immediate attention to avoid connectivity issues.
- **File Descriptor Usage**: Rising trend at 7, could indicate increasing load or resource usage. Monitor closely to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Process Uptime**: Rising trend at 6, could indicate potential stability issues if processes are not restarting as expected.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues & Alerts
- **Thais Connection**: Maxed out, indicating a network bottleneck.
- **Total CPU Cores**: Maxed out, indicating potential CPU overload.
- **System Usage**: Maxed out, requires immediate attention to prevent system failure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (< 1 hour)
- Investigate and resolve the Thais Connection bottleneck to ensure network stability.
- Assess CPU usage across all cores to identify and mitigate overload causes.

### Short-term Actions (< 24 hours)
- Monitor rising trends in file descriptor usage and process uptime to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Implement alerts for critical metrics to catch issues before they escalate.

### Long-term Optimizations (< 1 week)
- Conduct a capacity planning exercise to ensure infrastructure can handle peak loads.
- Optimize system processes and resource allocation to prevent future bottlenecks.

## üìà Performance Insights
Overall system health shows signs of potential bottlenecks, particularly in CPU and network areas. Rising trends in resource usage suggest increasing load, which could impact performance if not addressed.

## üéØ Key Metrics Summary
- **Total Widgets Analyzed**: 24
- **Widgets with Issues**: 5
- **Critical Alerts**: 3
- **Performance Score**: 5/10

Analysis indicates a need for immediate attention to critical areas and proactive monitoring to prevent future issues.
