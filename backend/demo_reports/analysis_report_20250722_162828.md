- **Memory Usage & Availability**: Memory usage is rising but remains within limits. Ensure sufficient memory allocation to avoid future issues.

### System Widgets
- **Disk I/O**: Both read and write operations are spiking, indicating potential bottlenecks. Immediate investigation is needed to prevent system slowdowns.
- **Network Traffic**: Network In is stable but high, while Network Out is rising. Monitor for potential congestion or bandwidth issues.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues & Alerts
- **Disk I/O Read/Write**: High I/O operations require immediate attention to avoid performance degradation.
- **Error Rate**: Spiking error rate indicates potential system reliability issues.
- **API Latency**: High latency suggests performance bottlenecks that need urgent resolution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (< 1 hour)
- Investigate and resolve high Disk I/O operations.
- Address spiking error rates to improve system reliability.
- Analyze and mitigate causes of high API latency.

### Short-term Actions (< 24 hours)
- Monitor CPU and memory trends closely to anticipate potential overloads.
- Investigate causes of container restarts and implement fixes.
- Review network configurations to handle rising Network Out trends.

### Long-term Optimizations (< 1 week)
- Conduct a comprehensive review of disk usage and optimize storage configurations.
- Implement caching strategies to reduce API latency and improve response times.
- Plan for capacity upgrades if rising trends in active users and session counts persist.

## üìà Performance Insights
Overall, the system is functioning within acceptable parameters, but several key areas require immediate attention to prevent performance degradation. Disk I/O, error rates, and API latency are critical areas needing urgent action. Continuous monitoring and proactive capacity planning will help maintain system health.
